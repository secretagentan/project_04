## General Approach
Ever since WDI Project #02, I wanted to learn how to use the Google Maps API after seeing some of my peers use it for their CRUD apps. I came up with the idea for a street art gallery during Project #03 and decided to commit to it early for this sprint. 

I spent the first two days brainstorming, researching the Google Maps APIs, and reading up on React
