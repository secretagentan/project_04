## Overview 

### User Stories

### Screenshots of App

### Technologies Used
- HTML/CSS

## Technical Requirements:
- [ ] **Be a full-stack application** with well-styled views on the front-end 
			supported with data and functionality from your own backend.
- [ ] **Have an interactive front-end** resulting in a great UX - sounds like a 
			great use case for a SPA.
- [ ] **Be relatively comprehensive**. For example:
			* CRUD multiple related data models.
			* Consume a third-party API.
			* Implement authentication and authorization. Consider implementing an admin 
				feature or two.
- [ ] **Implement thoughtful user stories** prioritized to help guide you.
- [ ] **Be deployed online** so that it's publicly accessible.

## Deliverables:
- [ ] A **working, full-stack application**, hosted somewhere on the internet 
			(Heroku is fine).
- [ ] A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project 
			and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
- [ ] **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
			* An embedded screenshot of the app
			* Explanations of the **technologies** used
			* A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
			* **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
			* Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had 
				to overcome
			* A table of your **routes** with their **auth** requirements.
- [ ] A **Trello board** that contains:
			* Your **user stories** organized in the appropriate list (Ice Box, 
				Current/MVP and Completed), moving from left to right.
			* Your **wireframes** â€“ sketches of the major parts of your UI in your 
				application.
			* Your **EDM** diagramming your models and their relationships.
